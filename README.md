# snek
simple snake game built using python and OpenGL

The primary goal of this is to reimerse myself into tech while giving myself a project sufficiently difficult that it is currently over my head.
The main difficulty of this project is learning how to properly animate objects in OpenGL, which is where the lions share of the work is.
Currently the steps are as such

1: project a stationary object on the screen
2: project a moving object on the screen
3: bind movement of the object to user input
4: set the snake movement to working
5: add in random placement of food objects
6: ???????
7: Profit
